  Bosch BMA456 triaxial acceleration sensor.  See more info at:
  https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/products/motion-sensors/accelerometers/bma456.html

compatible: "bosch,bma456"

include: [sensor-device.yaml, i2c-device.yaml]

properties:
  int1-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: false
    description: |
      Identifies pins for the INT1 on the sensor. 
  int2-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: false
    description: |
      Identifies pins for the INT2 on the sensor. 
                
  int-non-latched:
    type: boolean
    required: false
    description: |
      Specifies if the interrupts are non-latched. Default = latched

  anym-on-int1:
    type: boolean
    required: false
    description: |
      Indicates that the device driver should use interrupt 1
      for any movement. This is for boards that only have one
      interrupt line connected from the sensor to the processor.
      It disables the DataRDY interrupt

  anym-mode:
    type: int
    required: false
    default: 0
    description: |
      Select the interrupt mode for any movement.

      0 = OR combination of interrupt events
      1 = 6D movement recognition
      2 = AND combination of interrupt events
      3 = 6D position recognition

      The default of 0 is the power-on-reset value.
    enum:
      - 0
      - 1
      - 2
      - 3


  is-bmc150:
    type: boolean
    required: false
    description: |
      Specifies that the driver should adapt to the accelerometer
      capability provided by the BMC150 6-axis eCompass.  This affects
      the chip ID and the resolution of the measurements.
